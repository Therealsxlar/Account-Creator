# Account-Creator
> This basically creates an account but it has no functions and it's useless.

# I'm working on this
- Mongo Database Support if you need it (Download here)[https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-7.0.7-signed.msi]
- Actual legit proper Account System (i need to setup mongo or sql for this but wtv to easy)
- Making this code look clean asf and not messy.

# Expected from me
- Admin commands (ahh to easy)
- Battlepass command **With the discord bot** (Anyone can use)
- Progress command you guessed it **With the discord bot** (Anyone can use)
- V-Bucks changer **With the discord bot** (ADMIN ONLY)
- XP System **With the discord bot** (ADMIN ONLY)
- Level System **With the discord bot** (ADMIN ONLY)

You get it.
